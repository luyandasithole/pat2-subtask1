# over a telegraph or other communication devices. Each letter, number, and punctuation mark has its own unique sequence of dots and dashes
# allowing massages to be trasmitted  in a coded form.
# morse code was created to simplify communication assign shorter sequences to frequently used letters in english
# morse code was also created to enable long-distance communication by facilitating communication over telegraph lines and later radio signals
# morse code also adapt to new technologies which eliminated pauses and used consistent dashes
# basic elements: dots are short signals , while dashes are long signals with a duration three times that of a dot
# character represantation: each letter, number, and panctuation mark has a unique sequence of dots and dashes
# spacing: the duration between dots and dashes within a character is equel to one dot, between characters the space is three dots, and between words its seven dots
# transmission: morse code can be transmitted through various mediums, such as electric current
#eg s(...), o(---), A(.-), E(.)
